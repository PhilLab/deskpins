<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<h2>A quick example</h2>
<p>Although DeskPins interface is quite intuitive, here's an example with
instructions to get you started. Suppose you are checking a document and would
like to keep the Windows Calculator on top, in order to perform and verify
some operations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure DeskPins is running by looking at the system notification area
    (tray).
    If not already running, start DeskPins from the Start menu.</li>
  <li>Start Calculator.</li>
  <li>Click on the DeskPins icon at the  tray. The cursor will turn into a pin.</li>
  <li>Click on Calculator. A little pin icon will appear on its caption and the cursor
    will revert to its normal shape.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it! You've just pinned Calculator. To verify that it has been made
    topmost, try selecting the document window; it will become active but
    Calculator will still be over it.</p>
