<h1>Known Issues</h1>

<p>The following are known issues with DeskPins. Some of them are by-design,
meaning that they cannot be solved. The rest will probably be addressed in
future versions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some programs (like Winamp and WMP) change the shape of their windows to be
    non-rectangular. In these cases, the pin may float
    outside the visible area of the pinned window.<br>
    <br>
  <li>Some applications occasionally change their main window by hiding the current one and displaying another. In such cases, DeskPins
    will move the pin on the first visible top-level window it finds to ensure that the
    pin is always accessible. This is intentional.<br>
    <br>
  <li>On some applications (notably MS Office) the pin sometimes gets behind the
    pinned window. This minor problem does not affect the pin's
    functionality. Moving or resizing the offending window will bring the pin in
    front again.
</ul>
