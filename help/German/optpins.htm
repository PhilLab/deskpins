<h1>Pins Options</h1>
<h2>Pins settings</h2>

<p>This page allows you to customize the appearance and behavior of the pins.</p>

<p><b>Color</b><br>
Select your favorite pin color using the standard Windows color dialog. This
color also applies for the pin icon in the notification area (tray). Changing
this will update all existing pins automatically. The default color is red.</p>

<p><b>Tracking rate</b><br>
Controls how often each pin checks the pinned window's
position and state. Lower values will make the pins more responsive. The performance
of modern systems will not suffer even at the lowest setting. However, you might
want to increase this number on older computers. Changing this will update the
tracking rate of all existing pins. Valid range is 10 to 1000 msec.
The default value is 20 msec for Win2000/XP and 100 for older Windows versions,
because the latter cannot go below 50 msec.</p>

<p><b>Tray Icon Activation</b><br>
You can select whether you want&nbsp; to single-click or double-click on the
tray icon to enter pin mode. Earlier versions of DeskPins used the double-click
mode (which is the standard Windows behavior), but single-clicking has been
found to be more usable and is now the default.</p>
