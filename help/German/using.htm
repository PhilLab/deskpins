<h1>Using DeskPins</h1>
<h2>Working with DeskPins</h2>
<p>While <span lang="en-us">it </span>is running, DeskPins will place an icon  on the taskbar
notification area (systray). You can click on it to enter <a href="pinmode.htm">Pin mode</a>,
or right-click on it to display the <a href="traymenu.htm">Tray icon menu</a>. You can also use
<a href="hotkeys.htm">Hotkeys</a>
to perform certain actions.</p>
<h2>Pin indicator</h2>

<p>When a window is pinned, a small pin icon is placed on its caption, next to
the min<span lang="en-us">imize, </span>max<span lang="en-us">imize, and </span>close buttons, as a reminder. You can click on it to remove it and make the pinned
window normal again (non-topmost). Closing DeskPins will also remove all pins
currently in use.</p>

<p>You can safely minimize a pinned window to temporarily make room on the
screen for other programs. When you restore it, the pin will still be there and
the window will still be top-most.</p>

<p>Closing a pinned window (via the X button or Alt-F4) will automatically free the
associated pin.</p>
<p>You can find out how many pins are currently in use by right-clicking on the
DeskPins tray icon and selecting the &quot;About...&quot; command. The About
dialog displays the number of active pins using a bold font.</p>

<h2>Window ownership</h2>
<p>An application can have many windows. Some of them (for example, dialog boxes
or tool windows) are usually <i>owned</i> by another window, called the <i>owner
window</i>. This means that they are always shown on top of their owner. Since
it doesn't make much sense to pin an owned window by itself, DeskPins will
always check if the window you are trying to pin has an owner and pin <i>that</i>
instead. To see this in action, open Notepad and bring up the About dialog from
the Help menu. If you try to pin the About dialog, the pin will be placed on the
Notepad window. Of course, pinning an owner will also make all its owned windows
topmost.</p>
