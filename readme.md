DeskPins
========

This is the source code of DeskPins, a Windows program that can make any application window top-most.

This program was inspired by a discussion in the greek Usenet groups (grk.*). It was initially written in 2002 for Windows 95/98 using Visual Studio 6 and still works in modern Windows versions.
