Description
-----------
DeskPins can be used to make any application topmost, that is, to keep it 
above all other windows. Just grab a pin from the DeskPins icon in the system 
notification area (a.k.a. taskbar tray) and click on any window. This 
functionality is identical to the "Always on Top" setting found in some 
programs. With DeskPins you can add this feature to any program!
