Proxy mode not handled ok for Inno installers (VCL-based), e.g. bao0995u.exe.

Notification icon menu weirdness:
    1. right click tray icon
    2. enter pin mode
    3. cancel with right click
    4. right click tray icon
    5. The menu highlighting doesn't work anymore.
    This affects all notification icons' menus.
    Probably some problem with layerwnd clicks and tray notification area focus?
